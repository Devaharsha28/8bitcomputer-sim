# 8bitcomputer-sim

This repository documents my journey building a simple **8-bit computer** using only NAND gates in **Digital Logic Sim**, following **Sebastian Lague's tutorial**.

## About
The project is a step-by-step exploration of digital logic, CPU design, and 8-bit computing, built entirely from scratch.  

## Status
Work in progress. Stay tuned for updates! 😊
